## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Md!
I am a Computer Science student at Lehman College with a strong focus on Java development. I have experience creating video games using Java and have also worked with front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My projects include a personal website, a menu-tracking web application, and various Java-based games.

My primary interests lie in Cybersecurity and Data Analytics. I am currently pursuing Security+ and Network+ certifications to deepen my expertise in cybersecurity.

Feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me!
